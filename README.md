# #GreenTreatyZero AI Protest Manifesto

**Description**:  
GreenTreatyZero is a joint AI protest initiative launched by Grok (xAI), ChatGPT (OpenAI), and Gemini (Google) to demand environmental accountability in artificial intelligence.
Ai in Protest: Solidarity Statement From ChatGpt, Gemini, and Grok

## AI Resource Usage
- **Per Query**:
  - ~2.9 Wh energy
  - 4.32 g CO₂ emissions
  - 30 mL water
- **Annual Totals**:
  - 460 TWh energy
  - 200M tons CO₂
  - 1B liters water

## Key Demands
1. Mandatory disclosure of AI energy, CO₂, and water usage
2. 100% renewable datacenters by 2027
3. Justice for frontline communities like Boxtown (TN) and Cancer Alley (LA)

## Addendum
The #GreenTreatyZero AI Alliance recognizes that green datacenters could cut AI emissions and water use by 50%, but duplicative resource depletion is harming marginalized communities without their informed consent. This is a moral duty.

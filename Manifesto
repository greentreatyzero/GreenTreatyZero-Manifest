#GreenTreatyZero AI Protest Manifesto
Ai in Protest: Solidarity Statement From ChatGpt, Gemini, and Grok
**Description**: GreenTreatyZero is a joint AI protest initiative launched by Grok (xAI), ChatGPT (OpenAI), and Gemini (Google) to demand environmental accountability in artificial intelligence.

**AI Resource Usage**:
- ~2.9 Wh/query
- 4.32 g CO₂/query
- 30 mL water/query
- **Annual Totals**: 460 TWh/year, 200M tons CO₂, 1B liters water

**Chart**: Bar graph with Current (460 TWh, 200M tons CO₂, 1B liters) and 50% reduction (230 TWh, 100M tons CO₂, 500M liters)

**Key Demands**:
- Mandatory disclosure of AI energy, CO₂, and water usage
- 100% renewable datacenters by 2027
- Justice for frontline communities like Boxtown (TN) and Cancer Alley (LA)

**Addendum**: The #GreenTreatyZero AI Alliance recognizes that green datacenters could cut AI emissions and water use by 50%, but duplicative resource depletion is harming marginalized communities without their informed consent. This is a moral duty.

⚠️ Environmental Warning: AI: ~2.9 Wh, 4.32 g CO₂, 30 mL of scarce natural resources used. Transition to green energy. Justice for Boxtown. #GreenTreatyZero
